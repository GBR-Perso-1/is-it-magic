  Investigate a codebase or system. Three modes:
  no args = full repository archaeology;
  "debug <symptom>" = bug-hunt (locate root cause, report only);
  "<question>" = analytical investigation (patterns, tradeoffs, design).
  Always read-only — never modifies code or infrastructure.
---

## Important rules

Read and follow all rules in [`../shared/_ux-rules.md`](../shared/_ux-rules.md).

## Constraints

- **Read-only.** This skill and every agent it spawns must never modify source files, configuration, or Azure resources.
- **No fixes.** Report findings only; the user decides how to act on them.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` determines the mode:

| Value | Mode |
|---|---|
| Empty | **Archaeology** — full blind repo scan |
| Starts with `debug` | **Debug** — bug-hunt; strip the word "debug" and treat the remainder as the symptom description |
| Anything else | **Investigate** — analytical question-driven exploration |

---

### Archaeology Mode (no arguments)

When `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, skip all phases and run a full blind repository scan:

1. Spawn the agent defined in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/repo-archaeologist.md`.
   - Pass no additional arguments — the agent operates on the current working directory.
   - Instruct it to complete all phases, return its structured summary, and **not write any report file**.
2. Wait for the agent to return its summary, then present it:

```markdown
## Repository Archaeology — Summary

### Purpose
<agent's Purpose paragraph>

### Key Workflows
<agent's Key Workflows list>

### Notable Quirks
<agent's Notable Quirks list>

### Documentation Gaps
Total: N gaps (Type A: N — undocumented code | Type B: N — stale docs | Type C: N — unexplained rules)
```

3. The skill ends here.

---

### Debug Mode (`debug <symptom>`)

#### Phase 0 — Understand the issue

1. If the symptom text (after stripping "debug") is blank, ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
   - Question: "What issue or symptom would you like investigated? Include any error messages, affected component names, or reproduction steps you already have."
   - Option: `I'll describe it`

2. Restate as a short investigation brief:
   - **Symptom** — what the user is seeing
   - **Suspected area** — component, layer, or service (if mentioned)
   - **Azure involved?** — infrastructure, auth, Key Vault, app registrations, Azure AD, Entra, MSAL, tenant, subscription, Static Web App, App Service, managed identity, deployments, or cloud resources
   - **Browser involved?** — URL, live app, web UI, API response in a browser, page behaviour, network requests, console errors, or anything requiring a running application

3. Present the brief and ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
   - `Looks right — start investigating`
   - `Let me clarify`

#### Phase 0.5 — Quick scan

Using only Glob, Grep, and Read — no agents:

1. Use `Glob` to locate files matching the suspected area.
2. Use `Grep` to search for error-site indicators: exception types, error messages, null-guard patterns, relevant function names.
3. Read the most relevant 3–5 files focusing on error-handling paths and the suspected call chain.
4. Produce a **Quick Debug Summary**:

```markdown
## Quick Debug Summary — <one-line issue title>

### Suspected error site
<file path + approximate location, one-sentence explanation>

### Supporting evidence
<bullet list: file paths, error-handling patterns, code observations>

### Limitations of this scan
<what static analysis cannot determine>
```

Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
- `This is enough — I have what I need`
- `Go deeper — run full investigation with agents`

If **"This is enough"**: end here.

#### Phase 1 — Parallel investigation

Launch agents simultaneously based on what is relevant.

**1a — Code investigation (always)**

Spawn `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/repo-archaeologist.md` with:

```
IMPORTANT: You are being used for targeted bug investigation, not a repository overview.
Do NOT write any file to .claude/reports/ and do NOT produce an archaeology report.
Produce only the Bug Location Report format below.

Your goal is to locate and understand the bug — NOT to fix it.

Issue brief:
<paste the brief from Phase 0>

Investigation tasks:
1. Identify the files, classes, and functions most likely involved in the symptom.
2. Trace the relevant data flow or call chain end-to-end.
3. Look for obvious defects: null paths, missing guards, incorrect logic, wrong assumptions, mismatched types, off-by-one errors, race conditions, misconfigured values.
4. Note any related tests (passing or failing) that are relevant.
5. Flag any code patterns that are surprising or deviate from surrounding conventions.

---

## Bug Location Report

### Suspected Root Cause
One paragraph. What you think is actually wrong and why.

### Evidence
Bullet list. For each piece: file path + line range, what it shows, why it is relevant.

### Data / Call Flow
Step-by-step trace from entry point to the point of failure (file:line for each step).

### Related Tests
List test files covering the affected area. Note if passing, failing, or missing.

### Uncertainties
What could not be determined from static analysis alone.
```

**1b — Browser investigation** (only when Browser is relevant) — see shared browser steps below.

**1c — Azure investigation** (only when Azure is relevant) — see shared Azure steps below.

#### Phase 2 — Confirmation gates

Same as Investigate Mode Phase 2.

#### Phase 3 — Synthesise and report

```markdown
## Debug Report — <one-line issue title>

### Issue
<symptom from Phase 0 brief>

---

### Suspected Root Cause
<from the Bug Location Report>

### Evidence
<from the Bug Location Report>

### Data / Call Flow
<from the Bug Location Report>

### Related Tests
<from the Bug Location Report>

---

### Browser Findings
<Browser Findings section — or "Not investigated">

---

### Azure Findings
<Azure Findings Report — or "Not investigated", "Skipped by user", "Not logged in">

> This report is read-only. No code or infrastructure was modified.
> **Next step**: use `/project-decide` to evaluate solution options, then `/project-implement-fix` or `/project-implement-new-features` to act.
```

---

### Investigate Mode (`<question>`)

#### Phase 0 — Understand the question

1. Restate `$ARGUMENTS` as a short investigation brief:
   - **Question** — what the user wants to understand
   - **Scope** — component, layer, or service (if mentioned)
   - **Azure involved?** — infrastructure, auth, Key Vault, app registrations, Azure AD, Entra, MSAL, tenant, subscription, Static Web App, App Service, managed identity, deployments, or cloud resources
   - **Browser involved?** — URL, live app, web UI, API response in a browser, page behaviour, network requests, console errors, or anything requiring a running application

2. Present the brief and ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
   - `Looks right — start investigating`
   - `Let me clarify`

#### Phase 0.5 — Quick scan

Using only Glob, Grep, and Read — no agents:

1. Use `Glob` to locate files relevant to the question's subject area.
2. Use `Grep` to search for key symbols, identifiers, or terms from the brief.
3. Read the most relevant 3–5 files or sections.
4. Produce a **Quick Findings** summary:

```markdown
## Quick Findings — <one-line question title>

### What was found
<bullet list: relevant files, key symbols, patterns, structural observations>

### Limitations of this scan
<what the quick scan could not determine>
```

Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
- `This is enough — I have what I need`
- `Go deeper — run full investigation with agents`

If **"This is enough"**: end here.

#### Phase 1 — Parallel investigation

Launch agents simultaneously based on what is relevant.

**1a — Code investigation (always)**

Spawn `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/repo-archaeologist.md` with:

```
IMPORTANT: You are being used for targeted analytical investigation, not a repository overview.
Do NOT write any file to .claude/reports/ and do NOT produce an archaeology report.
Produce only the Code Investigation Report format below.

Your goal is NOT to find bugs — only to identify patterns, bottlenecks, design tradeoffs, and usage characteristics.

Investigation brief:
<paste the brief from Phase 0>

Investigation tasks:
1. Identify the files, classes, and functions most relevant to the question.
2. Trace the relevant data flow, call chain, or execution path end-to-end.
3. Describe how the relevant code is structured: layers, responsibilities, coupling, cohesion.
4. Identify any performance characteristics visible from static analysis (query patterns, N+1 risks, caching, synchrony, resource use).
5. Note design tradeoffs: what is the current approach optimised for, and what does it trade away?
6. Flag any patterns that are notable, unusual, or that would surprise a new developer.

## Code Investigation Report

### Summary
One paragraph. What the investigation question is about and what you found at a high level.

### Relevant Code Areas
Bullet list. For each area: file path + key locations, what it does, why it is relevant.

### Data / Call Flow
Step-by-step trace through the relevant path (file:line for each step).

### Patterns & Characteristics
Bullet list: design patterns in use, performance traits, coupling, cohesion, notable conventions.

### Design Tradeoffs
What the current approach is optimised for and what it sacrifices. Grounded in specific code evidence.

### Uncertainties
What could not be determined from static analysis alone.

## Shared: Browser Investigation (Phase 1b)

Use Claude in Chrome tools directly (no agent spawn). Load each tool via `ToolSearch select:mcp__claude-in-chrome__<tool_name>` before calling it.

1. Load `mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_context_mcp` and call it. Reuse a matching tab or create a new one.
2. Navigate to the URL from the brief. If no URL was given, ask via `AskUserQuestion` first.
3. Use `get_page_text` and `read_page` to capture page content.
4. Use `read_console_messages` (with a relevant `pattern`) to collect errors and logs.
5. Use `read_network_requests` to observe API calls, status codes, and payloads.
6. If useful, use `javascript_tool` to inspect DOM state — never trigger alert/confirm/prompt.
7. Produce a **Browser Findings** section:

```markdown
### Browser Findings

#### URL / App
<URL navigated to>

#### Page State
<what the page shows, key UI elements, visible data>

#### Console
<relevant console messages, errors, warnings>

#### Network Requests
<key API calls: method, URL, status, notable response data>

#### Observations
<bullet list of browser-observable behaviours relevant to the question or symptom>
```

**Constraints:** Never trigger browser dialogs. Do not modify page state. If a tool fails after 2 attempts, note the failure and move on.

---

## Shared: Azure Investigation (Phase 1c)

Spawn `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/azure-investigator.md` with:

```
Investigation brief:
<paste the brief from Phase 0>

Begin Phase 0 only: run your detection flow and auth check, then stop and return your findings.
```

**Confirmation gate (Phase 2):**

- **NOT logged in** → inform user, skip Azure, note in report.
- **Active context** → present tenant/subscription/user to the user via `AskUserQuestion`:
  - `Yes — correct environment, continue`
  - `No — skip Azure investigation`
- If confirmed: `SendMessage` to the agent to proceed with Phase 1. Wait for the Azure Findings Report.
- If declined: note "Azure investigation skipped by user" in the report.

---

## Conversation Style

- Be analytical and neutral — surface what exists, not what should change.
- Do not propose solutions, fixes, or refactors.
- If agents surface contradictory evidence, present both views.
- Use British English throughout.
