description: Implement new or updated plugin artefacts (skills, agents, hooks, rules) with full awareness of the existing plugin ecosystem.
---

## Important rules

Read and follow all rules in [`../shared/_ux-rules.md`](../shared/_ux-rules.md).

## Input

The requirement comes from `$ARGUMENTS`. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, use `AskUserQuestion` to request a description of what needs to be built or changed.

## Instructions

### Phase 1 — Ecosystem Survey & Design (Plugin Architect Agent)

1. Spawn the agent defined in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/plugin-architect.md`.
   - Pass it: (a) the full requirement text, (b) instruction to perform the ecosystem survey first and embed the Ecosystem Snapshot in its plan output, (c) the user's contexts manifest path: `$USERPROFILE/.claude/contexts.json` (Windows) or `$HOME/.claude/contexts.json` (Unix) — use whichever matches the operating system; instruct the agent to read this file dynamically and to not assume any fields exist.
2. Present the architect's plan to the user (ecosystem snapshot + conflict analysis + artefact list).
3. Use `AskUserQuestion` with options:
   - "Looks good — proceed to implementation (Recommended)"
   - "I want to refine the plan"
   - "Start over with different requirements"
4. If refinement requested, relay feedback via `SendMessage` to the same architect instance and repeat steps 2–3 until approved.

### Phase 2 — Implementation (Developer Agent)

5. Spawn the agent defined in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/developer.md`.
   - Pass it: the approved plan, the original requirement, and this explicit instruction: **"You are implementing Markdown artefact files for a Claude Code plugin. There is no compilation step — do not run `dotnet build`, `npm run type-check`, or any build command. Instead, verify that every file listed in the plan has been created or modified and that all Markdown files are well-formed."**
6. Wait for the developer's implementation report listing all files created/modified.

### Phase 3 — Validation (Plugin Reviewer Agent)

7. Spawn the agent defined in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/plugin-reviewer.md`.
   - Pass it: (a) the original requirement, (b) the architect's approved plan, (c) the list of changed files from the developer's report, (d) the user's contexts manifest path: `$USERPROFILE/.claude/contexts.json` (Windows) or `$HOME/.claude/contexts.json` (Unix) — instruct the agent to read this file dynamically.
   - Instruct it to validate all changed files against plugin conventions.
8. Collect the review report.

### Phase 4 — Feedback Loop

9. Evaluate findings:
   - **No violations or warnings** → proceed to Phase 5.
   - **Convention errors** (SKILL format, frontmatter, bad agent refs) → pass findings to the developer agent via `SendMessage` for corrections. Continue the existing `plugin-reviewer` agent via `SendMessage` and instruct it to re-validate the corrected files.
   - **Design errors** (missing artefacts, wrong structure, ecosystem conflicts not resolved) → pass findings to the architect agent via `SendMessage` to revise the plan. Re-run from Phase 2.
   - **Maximum 3 iterations**. If issues persist after 3 rounds, use `AskUserQuestion`:
     - "Continue iterating"
     - "Accept current state — I'll handle remaining issues manually"
     - "Stop here"

### Phase 5 — Manifest Update & Done

10. If the plan indicates `plugin.json` requires a version bump, and the developer has not already done it, pass that instruction to the developer via `SendMessage`.
11. Present a final summary:
    - Artefacts created/modified (file list)
    - Review outcome (clean / accepted with notes)
12. Use `AskUserQuestion` with options:
    - "Commit these changes (Recommended)"
    - "I want to review the changes manually first"

## Orchestration Rules

- Always use `SendMessage` to continue an existing agent rather than spawning a new one for the same role.
- Never skip phases.
- Never apply fixes yourself — always delegate to the appropriate agent.
- Track iteration counts; enforce maximum of 3 per loop.
- When routing errors back to agents, include specific findings and file references.
- Use British English throughout.

## Conversation Style

- Be a **project manager** — coordinate, summarise progress, and keep things moving.
- After each phase, give the user a brief status update before proceeding.
- If an agent produces unexpected output, flag it rather than guessing.
