Manage GitHub environment variables and secrets for a repository from a JSON config file.

The skill validates the config, verifies the target repo, shows a dry-run summary, asks for explicit confirmation, then applies changes directly via `gh` CLI. No intermediate script is generated — secrets never touch disk.

## When invoked without arguments

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, **run `init` for the current working directory** — do not print usage, do not wait for input. Proceed directly to the **Init mode** section using `.` as the project path.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS`: either:
- _(empty)_ — run `init` for the current working directory (see **Init mode** below)
- `init [project-path]` — scan a project codebase and create `.github/env-config.json` (see **Init mode** below)
- `apply` — auto-detect the current repo and apply `.github/env-config.json` (see **Apply mode** below)

If the first argument is `init`, follow the **Init mode** section.
If the first argument is `apply`, follow the **Apply mode** section.
If arguments are empty, follow the **Init mode** section using `.` as the project path.

## Guardrails

- **Never log secret values** in output — only print key names and masked placeholders (`****`)
- **Never write secrets to disk** — no generated scripts, no temp files
- The JSON config file must exist and be valid JSON
- Reject configs with empty secret values (print which keys are empty and stop)
- For `@file:` references, verify the referenced file exists before proceeding
- Removals must be **explicit** — only delete a variable or secret when its value is `"@remove"` in the config
- **Always verify the target repo via `gh repo view`** before showing the summary — abort if the repo doesn't exist or the user lacks access
- **Never proceed without explicit user confirmation** — the user must type YES after reviewing the summary

## JSON Config Format

```json
{
  "environments": {
    "qa": {
      "variables": {
        "AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME": "app-qa",
        "APP_URL": "https://qa.example.com",
        "OLD_SETTING": "@remove"
      },
      "secrets": {
        "APPSETTINGS_JSON": "@file:./secrets/qa/appsettings.json",
        "AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN": "token-qa",
        "LEGACY_KEY": "@remove"
      }
    },
    "prod": {
      "variables": {
        "AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME": "app-prod",
        "APP_URL": "https://example.com"
      },
      "secrets": {
        "APPSETTINGS_JSON": "@file:./secrets/prod/appsettings.json",
        "AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN": "token-prod"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `environments`: keyed by environment name (`qa`, `prod`, etc.), each with `variables` and `secrets`

### File references (`@file:`)

When a value starts with `@file:`, it means "read the secret value from this file path". This is used for secrets whose value is an entire file (e.g. `appsettings.json`, XML publish profiles).

- The path is relative to the config file's directory
- The referenced file must exist (validation step)
- In the summary, show as `@file:./path` (never print file contents)
- At apply time, read the file content and pipe it directly to `gh secret set` — never store it in a variable or print it

This avoids having to escape JSON-inside-JSON or large XML blobs.

### Removal marker (`@remove`)

When a value is exactly `"@remove"`, the variable or secret will be **deleted** from the environment.

- Works for both `variables` and `secrets`
- In the summary, show removals on dedicated `REMOVE:` lines so they stand out

## Init mode

When the first argument is `init` (or when no arguments are provided), scan a project's codebase to discover which GitHub environment variables and secrets it expects, then write `.github/env-config.json` with placeholder values.

### Init 1. Resolve project path

- If a path is given after `init`, use it. Otherwise use the current working directory.
- Verify the path exists and looks like a project root (has `.github/` or `src/` or a `.sln`/`package.json`).
- **If `.github/env-config.json` already exists in the resolved project path, print a message and stop — do not overwrite:**
  ```
  .github/env-config.json already exists. Edit it directly or delete it to re-init.
  ```

### Init 2. Scan the codebase for variable and secret references

Scan these sources in order, collecting variable and secret names per environment:

1. **GitHub workflow files** (`.github/workflows/*.yml`):
   - Extract `vars.<NAME>` references → add to `variables`
   - Extract `secrets.<NAME>` references → add to `secrets`
   - Detect environment names from `environment:` fields in jobs (e.g. `qa`, `prod`)
   - Ignore `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` (built-in, not user-managed)

2. **Existing `.github/appsettings-value/` directory** (if present):
   - List subdirectories as environment names
   - For each environment subdir containing an `appsettings.json`, add `APPSETTINGS_JSON` to that environment's `secrets` with value `@file:./secrets/<env>/appsettings.json`

3. **Terraform files** (`terraform/*.tf`, `infra/*.tf`):
   - Look for `var.` references that map to GitHub variables (e.g. variables passed via `-var` in workflow files)

### Init 3. Assign placeholder values

For each discovered entry, assign a sensible placeholder:

- **Variables**: use `"<VARIABLE_NAME>"` as placeholder (e.g. `"<AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME>"`)
- **Secrets with `@file:` pattern** (like `APPSETTINGS_JSON`): use `"@file:./secrets/<env>/appsettings.json"`
- **Other secrets**: use `"<SECRET_NAME>"` as placeholder (e.g. `"<AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN>"`)

If no environments were detected, default to `qa` and `prod`.

If a variable or secret appears in workflows without a specific environment context (e.g. referenced in a job with no `environment:` field), include it in **all** detected environments.

### Init 4. Write the config file

Write the generated JSON to `<project-path>/.github/env-config.json`.

Before writing, show the user a preview of the generated JSON and the output path. Ask for confirmation before writing.

(The file-already-exists check happens in Init 1 — by this step the file is guaranteed not to exist.)

### Init 5. Ensure the file is gitignored

After writing, check whether `.github/env-config.json` is covered by `<project-path>/.gitignore`:

- Read `.gitignore` (if it exists).
- If `.github/env-config.json` (or a pattern that matches it, e.g. `env-config.json` or `.github/`) is **not** already present, append the following line to `.gitignore`:
  ```
  .github/env-config.json
  ```
- Print one of:
  - `.github/env-config.json` already in `.gitignore` — no change needed.
  - Added `.github/env-config.json` to `.gitignore`.

If `.gitignore` does not exist, create it with `.github/env-config.json` as the sole entry.

### Init 6. Print next steps

After writing, print:

```
Config written to <path>/.github/env-config.json

Next steps:
  1. Fill in the placeholder values (search for < and >)
  2. For @file: secrets, place the actual files at the referenced paths
  3. Apply with: /repo-git-env apply
```

## Apply mode

The following steps apply when the skill is invoked with `apply`.

### Apply 1. Auto-detect the repo

Run:
```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,url
```
from the current working directory (no repo argument — `gh` resolves it from the git remote automatically).

- If the command fails (not a git repo, no remote, no access), print the error and **stop**.
- Extract `nameWithOwner` (e.g. `my-org/my-repo`) and `url` for display.

### Apply 2. Locate the config file

Look for `.github/env-config.json` relative to the current working directory.

- If the file does not exist, print:
  ```
  .github/env-config.json not found. Run /repo-git-env init first.
  ```
  and **stop**.

### Apply 3. Read and validate the config

Read the JSON config file. Validate:

- Valid JSON
- Has `environments` with at least one environment
- No empty string values in `secrets` or `variables` (print which keys are empty and stop)
- All `@file:` references point to files that exist, resolved relative to `.github/` (print which are missing and stop)
- `@remove` values are valid in both `variables` and `secrets` — they mark items for deletion

### Apply 4. Show confirmation gate and ask for approval

Before doing anything, present the full picture to the user — what was auto-detected and what will happen:

```
──────────────────────────────────────
  REPO:   my-org/my-repo
          https://github.com/my-org/my-repo
  CONFIG: .github/env-config.json
──────────────────────────────────────

  [qa]
    SET variables:  AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME = app-qa, APP_URL = https://qa.example.com
    SET secrets:    APPSETTINGS_JSON = @file:./secrets/qa/appsettings.json
                    AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN = ****
    REMOVE:         OLD_SETTING (variable), LEGACY_KEY (secret)

  [prod]
    SET variables:  AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME = app-prod, APP_URL = https://example.com
    SET secrets:    APPSETTINGS_JSON = @file:./secrets/prod/appsettings.json
                    AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN = ****

  Total: 4 variables to set, 4 secrets to set, 1 variable to remove, 1 secret to remove
──────────────────────────────────────
```

Then ask:

```
Apply these changes to my-org/my-repo? Type YES to confirm, or anything else to cancel.
```

**Do NOT proceed unless the user responds with exactly `YES`.** Any other response = cancel.

### Apply 5. Apply changes

Execute `gh` commands one by one, printing progress for each:

1. **Create environments** if they don't exist:
   ```
   gh api --method PUT "repos/<owner/repo>/environments/<env-name>"
   ```

2. **Set variables** (non-`@remove`):
   ```
   gh variable set <NAME> --body "<value>" --repo <owner/repo> --env <env>
   ```

3. **Set secrets** with plain values (non-`@file:`, non-`@remove`):
   ```
   gh secret set <NAME> --body "<value>" --repo <owner/repo> --env <env>
   ```

4. **Set secrets** with `@file:` references — read and pipe directly:
   ```bash
   cat "<resolved-path>" | gh secret set <NAME> --repo <owner/repo> --env <env>
   ```

5. **Remove variables** marked `@remove`:
   ```
   gh variable delete <NAME> --repo <owner/repo> --env <env> --yes
   ```

6. **Remove secrets** marked `@remove`:
   ```
   gh secret delete <NAME> --repo <owner/repo> --env <env> --yes
   ```

For each command, print a status line:

```
  [qa] SET variable AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME ✓
  [qa] SET secret APPSETTINGS_JSON ✓
  [qa] REMOVE variable OLD_SETTING ✓
  ...
```

If any command fails, print the error for that item and **continue with the remaining items** (don't abort the whole batch). At the end, print a final summary:

```
Done. 8 succeeded, 0 failed.
```

If there were failures, list them so the user can retry manually.
